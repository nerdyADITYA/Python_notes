python Libraries are set of useful functions so that we dont have to write the whole code from scratch.

Dictionary - a dictionary in python is used to store data in key valuues pairs.
student = {"name":"Aditya","Enrollment":"21C11029"}

Functions - a function is a set of code which only runs when it is called.

List - A list in python is used to store multiple items in a single variable.
food = ["pizza","burger","Eggs"]
dinner = random.choice(food)
print(dinner)

f strings is a slightly easier way to combbine strings and variables.
age = 25
print (f"Jim is {age} years old.")

Refactor - refactoring is the process of restructuring the code while keeping the original functionality

def greeting():
    return "hello word"

response = greeting()
print (response)


Variable - we can create a python variable by assigning a value to a lable by using the equal sign "=" the assinment operator
name1
HEIGHT
my_name
_name
These are all valid lables for a variable but,
123
test!
test@
A variable cannot start with a number and it should not have any kind of special characters; And the python keywords cannot be used as a variable.


Expressions - an expression is any kind of code that returns a value
Statement - a statement is an operation on a value

Comments - everytihng after a hashtag "#" is ignored in python; This is a special type of note or comments.

Data types:
1) String - anything surrounded by double quotations ("") is called a String.
2) Integer - numbers are represented as integers
3) Float -  floating point numbers are a type of fractions
4) Complex - 
5) Boolean
6) Lists
7) Tuples
8) Ranges
9) Dictionary
10) Sets

We can covert one data type to another by using the class constructor. This is called type casting.
age = float(2)
print (isinstance(age,float))

Operators:
1) Arithematic operators - Addition(+), subtraction(-), multiplication(*), division(/), remainder(%), square root(**), floor division(//)
2) Comparison operators - equals (==), not equals(!=), greater than (>), less than (<)
3) boolean operators - not means to check the statement is not true , and means they both have to be true , or means either one of them have to be true
4) Bitwise operators - & performs binary AND, | performs binar OR, ^ performs binary XOR operation, ~ performs a binary NOT operation, << shift left operation, >> shift right operation
5) is operator - it is an idendity operator which is used to compare two objects and returns true if both are the same objects.
6) in operator - it is called the membership operator this is used to tell if a value is contained in a list.
7) Ternary operator - it allows you to quickly define a conditional.

Booleans:
-> it returns true and false value.
-> all the numbers except for 0 are considered as true even negative numbers are true.
-> string are false only when empty similarly fro lists, Tuples, dictionary etc.

Built in functions:
Absolute - abs will return the absolute value of a number.
Round - round will round it up to the nearest integer.

Enums : enums are readable names that are bound to a constant value
enums are mostly used to create constants in python so that the value remains the same throughout the whole code

Lists:
lists are an essential python data structure.


FOR LOOPS
---------

syntax: for i in range(start of value, end of value , increment and decrement)

--> inside the range function we can enter 3 different arguments listed above.
--> we can also enter any one arument but it can only be the start of the value.
--> if we want to enter two argument we can use only start of the value and the end of the value.
--> we can also use any variable instead of the range function.
--> and the letter 'i' is a variable.
